# FEM with Collision

## Features
3D Deformable solid simulator using Co-rotational FEM
You can interact with it with the mouse and make it the floor or a cube.

The collisions are not fully thought out and inter mesh collisions dont work well

The documentation is bad. sorry.

## Building it

Depends on GLFW and Eigen and Tetgen and PQP

Linux support is iffy, there is some bug I have work  out

Windows support could happen if anyone wanted it

Mac OS X yes

You need GLFW Eigen and Tetgen in the directory above this repo and I'm not sure what else.

Use make -f makefile.mac on Mac OS X

I'm sorry for this, if people are interested I can change it.

# Where can I find more info?

Here's a youtube video showing what happens: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-yNQuEIRaM

Here's my academic paper explaining my methods: https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cscsp/99/

Here's some position based methods on deformable solid simulation. this is more sutiable for real time: http://matthias-mueller-fischer.ch/publications/STAR2013.pdf
