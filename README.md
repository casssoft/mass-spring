# FEM with Collision

##Features
3D Deformable solid simulator using Co-rotational FEM
You can interact with it with the mouse and make it the floor or a cube.

##Building it

Depends on GLFW and Eigen and Tetgen and PQP

Linux support is iffy, there is some bug I have work  out

Windows support could happen if anyone wanted it

Mac OS X yes

You need GLFW Eigen and Tetgen in the directory above this repo and I'm not sure what else.

Use make -f makefile.mac on Mac OS X

I'm sorry for this, if people are interested I can change it.
